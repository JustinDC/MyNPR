better categorization scheme
	incorporate categories

make ui better

local storage

make algorithm smarter
	smarter response to feedback
	avoid repeating
	for newsy topics, get from most recent 20
	otherwise, pick from a random range
		scan ALL topics maybe, to determine whether its newsy or not?
	incorporate related stories somehow
		maybe like 1/3 of the time, you just randomly pick a related story to be
		the next thing to be added to the queue

fix thumbs up and report feedback only at end of story and autoplay

Add robustness code for the following cases: (kind of optional, since we're just making
a demo)
	-User clicks next story too fast
	-internet problems
The solution is probably to spam requests, every 1,2,4,8s, kind of like how other apps deal with loss of connectivity.
